DESCRIPTION To ensure the safety and reliability of every unique car configuration before they hit the road, Daimler’s engineers have developed a robust testing system. As one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of premium cars, safety and efficiency are paramount on Daimler’s production lines. However, optimizing the speed of their testing system for many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach.  We are required to reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. Optimal algorithms will contribute to faster testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Daimler’s standards.
